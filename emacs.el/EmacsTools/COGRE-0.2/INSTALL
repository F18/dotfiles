How to install COGRE

1) Copy source files somewhere.

1.1) Install EIEIO CLOS library package from:
	http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml

2) Byte compile COGRE (optional, but recommended)

   a) Edit Makefile, and change LOADPATH to include the proper path to
	 EIEIO
   b) run "make"

   -OR-

   a) run: make LOADPATH="<path to eieio>"

   If byte compilation fails fails:
    a) Follow step 3:
    b) byte compile the files individually and interactivly from
	Emacs or XEmacs.

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.

(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/cogre")
(require 'cogre)

  You may also need to require other COGRE tool files until a
  formalized install process is made.
